Project Files:
The project contains several different codes, each one contributing to the development of the final project. 
stroke_ros_RandomForestClassifier_final.ipynb:
This notebook contains the main code for the stroke dataset, which includes cleaning the data, scaling it, training the model and making predictions. 
After testing multiple models, it was determined that RandomForestClassifier yielded the most accurate results, and was the final model used to predict a stroke. 
PredictingDisease.ipynb:
This notebook contains one of the codes for the heart disease dataset. Within this code, the data was cleaned, analyzed, and trained several machine learning models. 
app.py:
This python file contains the Flask file which sets up the different routes which each render a different use of the models. Each of these routes displays a different view of the interface, including the input of data from the user themselves. This input allows the models to predict the likelihood of the user contracting one of the aforementioned diseases.
